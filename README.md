# ChecklistStudy

After stratifying the participants based on level (graduate or undergraduate), we randomly assigned students to an experimental group (the Checklist group) or to a control group (the Coverage group).

In this study, students in the **Checklist group** were expected to complete the following in sequence:

- A [Preliminary Survey](https://github.com/ginaBai/TestingChecklistStudy/blob/main/PreliminarySurvey.pdf) 
- An unit testing project - [Bowling Score Keeper](https://github.com/ginaBai/TestingChecklistStudy/tree/main/BowlingScoreKeeper_ChecklistGroup)([Original Repo](https://github.com/ginaBai/UnitTesting_BSK))
- A [Post-activity Survey](https://github.com/ginaBai/TestingChecklistStudy/blob/main/Post-activitySurvey_ChecklistGroup.pdf) 


In this study, students in the **Coverage group** were expected to complete the following in sequence:

- A [Preliminary Survey](https://github.com/ginaBai/TestingChecklistStudy/blob/main/PreliminarySurvey.pdf) 
- An unit testing project - [Bowling Score Keeper](https://github.com/ginaBai/TestingChecklistStudy/tree/main/BowlingScoreKeeper_CoverageGroup)([Original Repo](https://github.com/ginaBai/UT_BowlingScoreKeeper))
- A [Post-activity Survey](https://github.com/ginaBai/TestingChecklistStudy/blob/main/Post-activitySurvey_CoverageGroup.pdf)
